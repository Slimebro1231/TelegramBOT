# BD Analysis Update Summary

## Changes Made

I have successfully updated all BD analysis functions in `bot.py` to match the new output requirements and format specification.

### Updated Functions

1. **`bd_reply_analysis()`** - Analyzes news when /bd is used as a reply
2. **`bd_content_analysis()`** - Analyzes provided URLs or text content
3. **`test_bd_command()`** - Demo function for testing BD analysis
4. **`handle_channel_bd_command()`** - Special handler for channel BD commands
5. **`bd_command()`** - Main BD command dispatcher and general analysis

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Output Format
**Old Format:**
```
1. BD Angles (max 3 bullets)
2. Matrixdock Synergy Score (per product with 2-line explanations)
3. Contact to Explore
```

**New Format:**
```
Matrixdock can partner on these three angles
Angle 1: [partnership opportunity]
Angle 2: [partnership opportunity]
Angle 3: [partnership opportunity]
This news is a X/10 opportunity for [most relevant product].
Reason 1
Reason 2
Reason 3
I suggest you reach out to
Name
Title
LinkedIn / email
```

#### 2. Updated Scoring System
- Changed from per-product scoring to single overall score
- Simplified to identify the most relevant product (XAUm, STBT, or Advisory & infra)
- Maintained the 3-dimensional scoring framework:
  1. TVL / Trading Volume Potential
  2. Direct Product Fit
  3. Strategic / Brand Lift

#### 3. Updated Contact Format
- Simplified to one contact person only
- Clear fallback: "No contact found." when unknown

#### 4. Updated Fallback Responses
All fallback responses now follow the new format structure:
- **General fallback**: 5/10 opportunity for Advisory & infra
- **Test command fallback**: 8/10 opportunity for XAUm (BlackRock example)
- **All other fallbacks**: Follow the consistent new format

### Scoring Criteria Maintained
- **Score Definitions**: 10 (flagship), 7 (high potential), 5 (some relevance), 3 (speculative), 1 (no synergy)
- **Asset-Specific Rules** for XAUm, STBT, and Advisory & infra remain unchanged
- **Focus areas**: Partnership, integration, distribution, or use case opportunities

### Files Modified
- `bot.py` - Updated all BD analysis prompts and fallback responses

The bot now generates BD analysis in the exact format specified in the user requirements, with concise, actionable insights following the structured output sample provided.
